okay first I tried running an example like the one you provided in the lesson 3: so I write the docker file and build it but there was problem w ith the building cause when installing cmatrix it askes and prompt user to enter options of keyboard layout and font and stuff related to that for rendering but because it was a command for my docker the user(me) couldn't enter numbers for those options so the build failed. then I removed the cmatrix option from the install and then it worked. but there was a thing I noticed when I run it, it did the neofetch stuff and immediately ended like it existed and got back to my normal arch terminal, it's like the it was only born to did the neofetch and the puff, not gonna accept any command or stay in it. then I also create a dockerfile which will print "Welcome to uwubuntu!" with figlet and running it resulted in the same stuff, like I will only print it and then exit, you won't get to give any more command and or see the command in the uwubuntu anymore.
