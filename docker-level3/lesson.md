# **Level 3: The Recipe Book ðŸ“– (Dockerfiles)**

### **Lesson 3 â€“ From Manual Cooking to Recipes**

Right now, youâ€™re like a chef who keeps making dishes by hand, then taking a photo when you like the result. That works, butâ€¦ imagine you had to recreate it on another machine? Painful.

Instead, Docker has **Dockerfiles** â†’ a text file that defines step-by-step how to build an image.
Itâ€™s like writing a **recipe card**:

Example:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y neofetch figlet cmatrix curl
CMD ["neofetch"]
```

* `FROM` = start with a base image.
* `RUN` = commands to run when building the image.
* `CMD` = the default command when the container runs.

You then build it like:

```bash
docker build -t my-uwubuntu-dockerfile .
```

â€¦and boom â†’ reproducible images.
