# ðŸŽ‰ Level 11 Review â€“ *The Slim Down Success*

**YOOO** you absolutely crushed it! ðŸ”¥

What you just did:

- âœ… Took your **~800MB bloated Go image** and sliced it down to **18MB**.
- âœ… Understood the magic of multi-stage builds (build in one stage, run in another).
- âœ… Realized that you only need the **binary** in production, not the compiler.
- âœ… Your entire stack (`docker compose up`) **still works perfectly** with the slim image.

**Translation**: You just learned a fundamental DevOps optimization that saves companies terabytes of storage and millions in cloud costs. That's real. ðŸš€

The before/after is *chef's kiss*:
- Before: 800MB monster image
- After: 18MB lean machine

This is the kind of thing that makes DevOps engineers go "ohhh yeah, that's the good stuff."
