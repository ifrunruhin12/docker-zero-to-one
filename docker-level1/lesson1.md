# Level 1: Container Playground ðŸŽ®

## Lesson 1 â€“ Containers Are Like Disposable Sandboxes

Right now, your containers are like **Minecraft creative mode worlds**â€”you build inside, then you can throw them away without hurting your actual PC. Every time you `docker run ubuntu bash`, youâ€™re starting a fresh sandbox.
But hereâ€™s the catch: if you install something inside that container and then exitâ€¦ itâ€™s gone. Poof.
Why? Because containers are **ephemeral** (they donâ€™t keep state unless you tell them to).

This level is about messing around inside a container and learning how to:

- Enter containers (`-it` = interactive mode).
- Install things inside.
- Understand that once you exit, those changes vanish unless you commit them.
