## 📝 Level 10 Review

Before we jump in, let's recap what you just did:

You built a **full-stack application** with Docker Compose that included:

- A PostgreSQL database with initialization scripts, a Go API server with REST endpoints, and Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Custom networking so all services could communicate using container names
- A request chain: Browser → Nginx → Go API → PostgreSQL → back out

This is **production-level thinking**. You understand:
- ✅ Multi-container orchestration
- ✅ Custom networks
- ✅ Service dependencies
- ✅ Volume mounting for databases
- ✅ Environment variables for configuration

**You're officially past "learning Docker basics" → you're in "real-world applications" territory.**
