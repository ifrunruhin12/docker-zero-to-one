okay so in this step I created a Dockerfile inside docker-level4 folder. this docker file first do FROM ubuntu:latest so that it runs ubuntu than I ran some command like first api-get update so then I can install other packages and then put command to install neofetch, figlet, python3, neovim and then did command figlet yo first. so after building and running of course it just print yo with figlet and then exit. so then I edited the Dockerfile and run the command "bash" now when I ran it after vuilding, it didn't exited instantly instead I could show a bash of ubuntu, I ran neofetch command, figlet commands, even open nvim inside the container and even create python file, and opened python terminal intrepreter and then exited
