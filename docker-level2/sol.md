okay for task 2, I did run docker ps -a commited my last ubuntu session on docker in which I installed neofetch, figlet, cmatrix, curl etc. give it name "my-uwubuntu" then did docker images to check it exist and it does so then I ran it using "docker run -it my-uwubuntu". and yes the tools did exist. I installed python3 after that and then existed but as this time I didn't commit again, when I got back and ran my-uwubuntu again, all the stuff existed except the python3 and a hello.py program that I wrote that time.
