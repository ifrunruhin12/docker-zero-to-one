## Task 0 – Hello, Docker!

Goal: Run your **first container**. Don’t worry if it’s super simple.

1. Pull a Docker image from Docker Hub. (hint: use `docker pull`)
2. Run it. (hint: `docker run`)
3. Check that it’s running. (hint: `docker ps`)

💡 Hint if stuck:

- Start with something tiny, like hello-world.
- Think of it like “I just want to see Docker say hi to me.”
