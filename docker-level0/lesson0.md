# Lesson 0 – What the hell is Docker?

Docker is like having a mini virtual world inside your computer that runs your app, with all its tools, libraries, and dependencies. Imagine you built a game on your PC, but it breaks when you run it on your friend’s PC because “my computer has it, yours doesn’t.” Docker solves this by packaging your app with everything it needs—so it runs anywhere, no headaches.

## Key concepts:

- Image → The blueprint. Think of it like a “frozen pizza recipe.”
- Container → A live instance of that image. That’s your actual pizza, cooked and ready to eat.
- Docker Engine → The thing running Docker on your PC (the oven).
- Docker Hub → A place where people share images (like pizza recipes online).

**⚡ Fun fact**: Docker doesn’t emulate an OS like a VM, it uses your OS kernel, which makes it super fast.
