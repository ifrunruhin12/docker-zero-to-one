## 📝 Level 0 Review

- You installed Docker (engine ready ✅).
- You ran **hello-world** → proof Docker is working ✅.
- You jumped inside an **Ubuntu container** → saw how containers are mini isolated worlds ✅.
- You pulled **Alpine** → you now know images can be tiny and specialized ✅.

Translation: You now **understand what Docker is and how to spawn life inside it**. That’s basically step one to becoming a container sorcerer. 🧙‍♂️
