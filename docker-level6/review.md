# 🧠 Why Bother With Docker?

Right now on Arch, you can just run `go run main.go` and it works fine.
But imagine these scenarios:

---

## 1. **Consistency Across Machines**

* On *your* Arch → Go is installed, correct version, libraries, everything works.
* On your teammate’s Ubuntu → maybe they don’t have Go, or have Go 1.19 instead of 1.23, or missing dependencies.
* On a production server → maybe Go isn’t installed at all.

With Docker:

* You package your app **with Go runtime + all dependencies inside one image**.
* Anyone with Docker can run it exactly the same way.
* “It works on my machine” → **no longer a problem**.

---

## 2. **Isolation (No Polluting Your Host)**

* Right now, you had to install Go on your host.
* For Python apps → you’d need Python, pip, virtualenv.
* For Node apps → npm, Node versions, etc.

With Docker:

* Each app lives in its own isolated container → doesn’t mess with your host’s environment.
* You can run 3 apps with 3 different Go/Python versions **side by side** without conflicts.

---

## 3. **Easy Shipping & Deployment**

Imagine you need to deploy your Go app to a server:

* Without Docker → you’d install Go, copy your code, compile, set up configs, systemd services, etc.
* With Docker → just copy your image → run it with `docker run -p 8080:8080`.
* Deployment = one command. 🚢

This is literally why it’s called *Docker* → like shipping containers. Same box, same contents, works everywhere.

---

## 4. **Scalability**

* When your Go app needs to scale (say, handle 10k requests/second), Docker lets you spin up multiple containers easily.
* Later, you’ll orchestrate them with **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes**.

---

## 5. **Security Sandbox**

* Containers isolate processes → your Go app doesn’t have full access to your host.
* If the app gets hacked, damage is limited inside that container.

---

## 📝 **Level 6 Review**

* You successfully Dockerized your Go app 🎉.
* You noticed it feels the same as running locally → because right now, it is.
* The big brain unlock: **Docker isn’t for “running apps on your own PC faster.” It’s for running them consistently, securely, and anywhere — from your laptop to a production cluster.**
