# **Level 5: The Shipping Container ðŸš¢**

### **Lesson 5 â€“ Ports & Networking**

Right now, your containers are like secret labs â€” stuff happens inside, but the outside world (your host machine) canâ€™t access it.

If you run a **web server inside a container**, you wonâ€™t see it on your browser unless you **map ports**. Thatâ€™s like cutting a door in your shipping container so people can visit.

For example:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

* `-p 8080:80` â†’ maps **port 8080 on your machine** to **port 80 inside the container**.
* So if nginx listens on port 80 inside the container, you can visit `http://localhost:8080` outside.

âš¡ Fun fact: without `-p`, the server is running but only accessible *inside* the container.
