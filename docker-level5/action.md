I did pulled nginx and did run it with docker run -p 8080:80 ngnix and I saw a nginx welcome page. but I don't understand so many things like how does it works on a deeper level. I know nginx is a web server, and docker is running the server inside it? how can I see it in my browser at port 8080? I did docker ps and saw it running and then kill it using Ctrl + C instead of doing docker stop <container_id> lol. then I ran it again and this time used docker stop to stop it. so now suppose I wrote a simple web app using go and dockerized it so if I run it like this I can see it in my host's localhost port 8080?
